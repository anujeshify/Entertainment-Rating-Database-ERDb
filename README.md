![alt text](https://github.com/anujeshify/Entertainment-Rating-Database-ERDb/blob/master/Extras/logowhite.png)

This software project is developed to automate the functionalities of a ENTERTAINMENT RATING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. 
The name of this database is ERDb which stands for Entertainment Rating Database. The purpose of the software project is to develop the Management Information System (MIS) to automate the record keeping of ratings and other details of Movies, Television Shows, Games and Anime with a view to enhance the decision making  of the functionaries. 
This software, being simple in design and working, does not require much of training to users, and can be used as a powerful tool for automating an ENTERTAINMENT RATING DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
During coding and design of the software Project, Python IDLE, as a powerful front-end tool is used for getting coding simplicity. As a back-end a powerful, open source RDBMS, MySQL is used.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This software project is developed with the help of certain programs and some prerequisite python modules which facilitate the working of the program and make it presentable.

The Softwares used:
•	Microsoft Windows® 10 Pro as Operating System.
•	Python 3.8.5 as Front-end Development environment.
•	MySQL as Back-end Sever with Database for Testing.
•	Mysql.Connector to connect Python module with database.
•	Tabulate module to present tuples fetched from database into tables in python.

### Installing

I have used mysql.connector and tabulate modules in our python code. Mysql.connector module helps establishing connectivity between python and MySQL. Tabulate module helps us to present tabular data in a nicely formatted table in python. Following are the steps to install both the modules.

Steps to Install mysql.connector module

```
Step - 1 : Open command prompt from Start
Step - 2 : Enter command “python -m pip install –upgrade” 
Step - 3 : Enter command “install mysql.connector”
